# HGT_network
A bioinformatics tool for analyzing horizontal gene transfer (HGT) networks in microbial communities.

## Overview

HGT_network is developed by DeepOmics Lab to analyze horizontal gene transfer network in complex microbial datasets . This tool focuses on constructing HGT networks to understand the dynamics of gene flow between different microbial species, which is crucial for understanding microbial evolution and antibiotic resistance spread .

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepomicslab/HGT_network.git
cd HGT_network
```

## Usage
Unzip data.zip at current directory.  
After that, the scripts in script/ can be used to reproduce the result. Please run the scripts in order following the number of scripts.

## Plot data
Data of the plots in paper can be found in HGT_plot_data.zip.
